## Behind the Name

Banchan Art is named for the Korean culinary tradition of shared side dishes.

Banchan includes a variety of dishes with different flavors and meanings. Each
meal is a unique experience due to the constantly rotating selection of dishes
and your ability to cater your meal by how much of each dish you select for
yourself. You are able to satiate your palate for different tastes as you
please.

The idea behind Banchan Art is to build a platform that provides a meeting
point for artists and their supporters. This is a place where both artists and
their patrons can customize their experience in a mutually beneficial and
harmonious way. Our ideal for the platform is to make it easy and enjoyable to
commission a custom piece of art for both sides. Similar to choosing different
amounts of banchan to cater a meal to your taste, supporters can choose from
different options set up by artists to commission the art piece that they will
treasure.
