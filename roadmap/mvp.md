# Banchan Art MVP draft
This is a rough draft of features we want to include in MVP.
## Major MVP features
1. Basic profile pages for denizens
2. Basic profile pages for studios
3. Merge denizen/studio namespace so you can just go to banchan.art/someusername and it'll go to either a studio or a username, just fine.
4. Some basic styling beyond default bulma styles
5. Full end-to-end experience for commissioning 
6. Explore existing studios by topic
7. Way for studios to manage their gallery/portfolio and link pieces as examples for specific commission options

## Commissions Experience
1. Studios, and studios managing their offerings that will be displayed on their studio page.
2. Commission slot management for creating and existing commissions available
3. Commission submission page complete, including sample file uploads, ToS support 
4. Commission communication page ready, including ability to accept or decline commission request, various essential events, proper styling and UX test, status management, file uploads and viewing, editing of offering to add extra/custom requests, and being able to provide any number of payments over the course of the commission through stripe.
5. Commission history page for studios--display active and closed commissions. Filters added to this after MVP.
6. Commission history page for denizens. Same as above, pretty much, for now.
7. Payment Processing integration (ie stripe mentioned above)
