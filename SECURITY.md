# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of Banchan is currently supported at any given point in time. Please make sure to keep your version up to date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you find something that might need attention, please do NOT make an issue for it. Instead, please contact security@banchan.art and we'll take it from there.

Unfortunately, we don't currently have a bounty program, mostly due to budget constraints.
